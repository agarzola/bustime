## Utility methods
`bustime` also offers a method for collecting data from the BusTracker API to store in memory or commit to a file for later use in your app. There is only one such method at the moment, but more may be added in the future. [Open an issue](https://github.com/agarzola/bustime/issues) if there’s a specific utility you’d like to see implemented.
